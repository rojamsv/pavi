Car Price Prediction Project – Summary

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the price of a car based on important features such as year, mileage, and engine size (CC). The goal is to help users estimate a car’s market value using data and machine learning.

A small dataset is created containing car details and their selling prices. The data is divided into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is used because it is simple, accurate for small datasets, and suitable for predicting numeric values.

The model is trained using the training data and then tested on unseen data to evaluate performance. Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score are used to measure how well the model predicts prices.

After training, the model can predict the price of any new car by providing its year, mileage, and engine capacity. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in real-life scenarios such as the used-car market to estimate car prices more accurately.
Project Proposal: Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
1. Project Title

Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

2. Introduction

Car prices vary depending on several factors such as manufacturing year, engine capacity, mileage, and condition. Buyers and sellers often struggle to estimate the correct market value of a used car.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a car using key features, making price estimation easier and more reliable.

3. Problem Statement

Determining the accurate price of a used car is challenging due to many influencing factors.
Traditional guessing methods are inaccurate and time-consuming.
Hence, there is a need for a data-driven prediction system that can estimate car prices automatically.

4. Objectives

To collect and prepare car data for analysis.

To explore features such as year, mileage, and engine capacity.

To build a machine learning model using Linear Regression.

To evaluate and validate the model's prediction accuracy.

To predict the price of new car inputs provided by the user.

5. Scope of the Project

This project focuses on:

Training a prediction model on car data

Using basic machine learning algorithms

Predicting the cost of used cars

Demonstrating real-world application in the automobile market
