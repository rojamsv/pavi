Car Price Prediction Project – Summary

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the price of a car based on important features such as year, mileage, and engine size (CC). The goal is to help users estimate a car’s market value using data and machine learning.

A small dataset is created containing car details and their selling prices. The data is divided into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is used because it is simple, accurate for small datasets, and suitable for predicting numeric values.

The model is trained using the training data and then tested on unseen data to evaluate performance. Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score are used to measure how well the model predicts prices.

After training, the model can predict the price of any new car by providing its year, mileage, and engine capacity. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in real-life scenarios such as the used-car market to estimate car prices more accurately.
